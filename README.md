#The Big Bang#

This is going to be my spare-time project which will involve implementations of some classical and interesting papers in physically based simulation. 

- Stable Fluids
- Real-Time Subspace Integration for St.Venant-Kirchhoff Deformable Models
- Position Based Dynamics
- Discrete Elastic Rods
- Predictive-Corrective Incompressible SPH
- Numerical Coarsening of Inhomogeneous Elastic Materials
- ...
